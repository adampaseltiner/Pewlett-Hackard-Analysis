# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Resources
PostgreSQL 12.7, pgAdmin 4

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to use SQL to perform analysis on the employees of Pewlett-Hackard to determine which employees are eligible for retirement and how those numbers might affect the company's decisions regarding employment and mentorship in the future.

## Results

- We were able to determine that out of the 300,024 employees at Pewlett-Hackard that 90,397 (or 30.12%) are eligibile for retirement. That is an alarmingly high percentage of employees that could easily and quickly choose to stop working and could potentially leave a large gap in the Pewlett-Hackard workforce. 

- Analyzing these retirement eligible employees by job title shows that a majority of them are Engineers or Staff, which comprises 28.04% of the total number of employees:
